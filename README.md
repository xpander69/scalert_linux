Scenario Alert for Warhammer: Return of Reckoning through Desktop Notification
Based on Caffeine Windows Sirena.exe
Modified by Xpander


1) Install ScenarioAlert addon https://www.returnofreckoning.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=20524

2) Place contents of the folder ScAlert_Linux to ~/warhammer-online-return-to-reckoning/prefix/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Return of Reckoning/logs

So the logs folder will contain: audio folder, scalert_linux.sh, warhammer-online-icon.png and this readme.txt

3) Run game, make sure addon is enabled

4) Run scalert_linux.sh (you can create symlink of the script to the place you want, or use another script to run it)

After you have completed steps 1 to 4 it will not matter which you start first - scalert_linux.sh or the game.
You also don't have to restart scalert_linux.sh if you relog to another character or restart the client.
